# Lab 1- Learning System Verilog with Verilator and VBuddy

**System Verilog:** a hardware description and verification language (HDL) mostly for designing digital hardware.

**Verilator:** A software package to simulate SV. Circuit states only evaluated once in a clock cycle. It doesn't evaluate time within a clock cycle, therefore only suitable for functional verification without timing information
